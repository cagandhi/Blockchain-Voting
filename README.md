# Blockchain-voting
A proof of concept model for for a voting system based on block-chain technology. This was my project for the "Computer Networks" course.

A proof of concept (POC) model for a voting system based on blockchain technology. This approach tries to address the security concerns in the omnipresent electronic voting machines by making available the encrypted data at all nodes in the network should someone hack the primary storage of the votes.
