# Blockchain-voting
A proof of concept model for for a voting system based on block-chain technology. This was my project for the "CSC 330: Computer Networks" course at Ahmedabad University.

Objective: Develop a proof-of-concept (POC) model for a voting system based on blockchain technology.

The POC model broadcasts the encrypted block of votes in blockchain.
The nodes in the P2P network represent the voting machines.
The encrypted block of votes is available at all nodes in the network in case the central storage of the votes is
attacked.

I am thankful to [pystone](https://github.com/pystone/ProcessMigration) for making their code public.

To view results of project, clone the project and execute command "java -jar Blockchain_voting.jar".
